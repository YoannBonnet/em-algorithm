# **Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm Implementation in R**

The EM algorithm consists of two main steps: the Expectation step (E-step) and the Maximization step (M-step). In the E-step, the algorithm calculates the expected value of the log-likelihood function given the current estimates of the parameters. In the M-step, the algorithm updates the parameter estimates by maximizing the expected log-likelihood found in the E-step. These two steps are repeated iteratively until the algorithm converges to a local or global maximum.
